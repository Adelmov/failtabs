What have I learned so far that has helped me to become a self-sufficient
The learner is that if I get errors that I haven't ever got I will search it on google or read forums about those errors. Another thing that I have learned so far is to always double check the code and run it several times to see if there are any errors. I also have learned that to learn code faster for me is better to see an example of the code.
What I have left to learn is how to code faster and how to find more simple and fasters ways to solve problems in big chunks of code.
